# Acceptance Tests
There is not much about the structure of these tests to document.  They're
vanilla Gomega test suites, with a normal amount of quirk (like files named
"test" that don't test anything).

## Current Tests
### bake_test.go
Considers log output as part of the API but otherwise is cromulent.
